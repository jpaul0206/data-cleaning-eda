# data-cleaning-eda
I worked on a data cleaning and exploratory data analysis project in MySQL for a company's layoffs dataset. The process involved detecting and removing duplicates, standardizing formats, handling null values, and correcting inconsistencies. I utilized advanced SQL techniques such as CTEs and window functions for data manipulation. The EDA included aggregating and summarizing key metrics like total layoffs by company, location, country, industry, and year.
