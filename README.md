# data-cleaning-eda
Data cleaning and EDA project in MySQL for a company's layoffs dataset, detecting and removing duplicates, standardizing formats, handling null values, and correcting inconsistencies. I utilized advanced SQL techniques such as CTEs and window functions for data manipulation. The EDA included aggregating and summarizing key metrics.
